<h2 id="cds-videos">CDS Videos</h2>
<p><strong>I just entered CDS Videos but I cannot see the video uploaded by my collegues, the video I need</strong></p>
<p>If you know some metadata (information) about the video such as title, author, etc. type it in the Search CDS field at the top, to find you video. If you still cannot find the video in the list of results, you can refine your search with the facet options on the left of the screen.</p>
<p><strong>How to upload a video?</strong></p>
<p>Click on the &quot;upload&quot; link close to your account name (you might have to log in).
Click on the &quot;New Upload&quot; button.
Upload your video file either selecting it or by URL.
In the screen that appears, you can check the upload progress of the video and the extraction of other files and formats (other video formats, thumbnail pictures, etc.) and you can also enter metadata about the video.
Automatically a &quot;Project&quot; is created: the Project will allow you to group several (master) videos together, if needed, and to group other files associated to the video (e.g. pdf or slides of the presentation, etc.).
Note that you have to select the Category and Type of video, which will set the access rights and visibility.
Note that the video and the associated data and files are not be available publicly yet, the upload being in Draft state untill you set it to Published state.
To do that and for more details on completing the upload of the video, see &quot;How to publish a video?&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>How to publish a video?</strong></p>
<p>Note that even when the upload is finished the video will not be accessible publicly, as it is in Draft state.
In order to publish the video(s) it is needed to fill in the mandatory metadata for the video, that is, the fields in the Basic Info tab marked with a red asterisk.</p>
<p>You can start filling the information/metadata while the video is processed by the system, after it is fully uploaded.</p>
<p>When all the metadata of the video and of the project (only the category and type is mandatory) is filled in correctly and saved, the corresponding &quot;Publish&quot; buttons will be active. You&#39;ll be able to publish a single video or the entire project (all the videos contained will be published at once).
The publish operation will make the video available for public view.</p>
<p>You can restrict the access to the video in the Access rights tab of the video (similarly for the project).
In the project you can also share your rights to maintain the draft version.</p>
<p><strong>How can I upload subtitles for my video?</strong></p>
<p>Subtitles in CDS Videos must be .vtt format files associated to the video file. Open the Files tab of the video frame (if you just started the upload of the video, you might need to wait for it to take place, depending on the size).
Then follow the instructions in the Subtitle frame.</p>
<p><strong>How to access high resolution CERN copyrighted material?</strong></p>
<p>Click on the link of the high resolution version of the file (&quot;Master video&quot;).
The conditions of use are then displayed. You can agree or disagree to the conditions of use by clicking on the &quot;Agree&quot; or &quot;Disagree&quot; button. If you accept the conditions, the download will start.
Note that if a file is restricted and you are not logged in, you will be redirected to the CERN central login page. Follow the instructions on-screen to login (or request lost password, etc.).</p>
<p><strong>Who can download high resolution multimedia files?</strong></p>
<p>Anybody (journalists, physicists, individuals, etc.) who agrees to the conditions of use. Note that for some usages (personal use for computer wallpaper, inclusion in slides, etc.) you might want to download a lower resolution of the file, which remains a good quality enough. The lower resolutions files remains under CERN copyright, and the same conditions of use apply.</p>
<p><strong>What are the conditions of use?</strong></p>
<p>The conditions of use can be found at <a href="http://copyright.cern.ch/">http://copyright.cern.ch/</a>. There you can also find contact information to request more detailed information.</p>
<p><strong>When I try to download, I get this message &quot;Redirect Loop&quot;</strong></p>
<p>Your web browser is most probably configured to use a web proxy to connect to HTTP servers, but not for connecting to (secure) HTTPS servers.
To simplify, this makes you appear as two different users on our side, when you try to login, which we strictly forbid for security reasons on the CERN Document Server.</p>
<p>To solve this problem, you might want to either enable your browser proxy for both HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443), or to disable it for both protocols.</p>
<p><strong>When I try to download, I get a blank page</strong></p>
<p>You are probably using a browser extension preventing the download to start. For example we have noticed in the past that extension &quot;AdBlock&quot; was preventing users from downloading files</p>
<p>To solve this problem, please temporarily disable any extension blocking the download.</p>
<p><strong>Internet Explorer tells me that the website is encountering problems.</strong></p>
<p>Size of files that can be dowloaded by Internet Explorer is limited according to the IE version. Please update IE or use another browser to download large files.</p>
<p><strong>How can I get a better resolution of a document?</strong></p>
<p>The documents on the CERN Document Server are generally already the highest quality available.</p>
<p><strong>What about low resolution multimedia files?</strong></p>
<p>Low-res files are also protected by the CERN copyright, and subject to the same conditions of use as high resolutions files. Though you will not need to login to access them, you agree to the same conditions (including the CERN computing rules) by downloading this material.</p>
